This file contains several configurations for the site such as the site title, description, other metadata and your
personal details. This file has three main sections:

- SITE
- ME
- SOCIAL

Those sections are arrays of objects that contain the following properties:

#### SITE

|--------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name         | string | Your name.                                                              |

#### SOCIAL

In this section, you can add your social media profiles. Each object should have the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the social media platform.
- `url`: The URL of your profile on that platform.
- `icon`: The icon used for the social media platform. By default, the project already have the most common social media
  platforms. If you want to add a new one, you should add the icon in SVG format in the `src/icons` directory.
- `show`: A boolean value to show or hide the social media platform. I recommend to hide the platforms that you don't
  have a profile and also have as maximum 4 social media platforms.

If you have configured the project correctly, you should see something like this:

![Personal Info Section](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/biography-fa3a3.appspot.com/o/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2018.39.59.png?alt=media&token=444bf708-da0a-4e19-8104-d5d071d73c53)

And also the Meta Tags in the Head of the HTML should be working correctly.
